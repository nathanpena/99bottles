# 99 Bottles Ruby Project

This project is a Ruby-based implementation of the classic "99 Bottles of Beer" song, showcasing my software engineering skills. The code is structured to dynamically generate the lyrics of the song, and includes automated tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

## Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to write clean, modular Ruby code while integrating automated testing. These skills are essential for building scalable, maintainable software solutions, which are critical in both data engineering and data analysis.

### Skills Demonstrated:

- **Ruby Programming**: The code is written in Ruby, demonstrating my proficiency in dynamic programming languages.
- **Test-Driven Development**: The project includes automated tests, highlighting my experience with writing tests to ensure code reliability and correctness. This practice is crucial in software development, including data engineering, where data pipelines need rigorous testing.
- **Data Automation**: The program automates the generation of the "99 Bottles" lyrics, showing my ability to automate repetitive tasks, a skill that is transferable to automating data workflows and processes in data engineering.

## Features

- **Dynamic Lyric Generation**: Generates the lyrics of the "99 Bottles of Beer" song, with code structured to dynamically adjust based on the number of bottles.
- **Automated Testing**: The project includes unit tests that validate the output of the lyric generator, showcasing the importance of testing in software development.

## How This Applies to Data Engineering & Data Analysis

- **Automation**: The automation of generating lyrics mirrors the automation tasks common in data engineering, such as data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
- **Testing & Reliability**: The inclusion of tests ensures that the program runs correctly, a principle that applies to building reliable data pipelines and analytical tools.
- **Modular Code**: The clean, modular design of the code makes it scalable and maintainable, which is crucial in large data engineering projects where maintainability and scalability are key.
